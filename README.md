# TextMastermind
Mastermind made with only text and written in Python.

# Objective:
To correctly guess the random pattern created by the computer from the list of colors.

# How to Play:
The computer will generate a random sequence of 4 colors from the list of colors (colors can repeat). You have to guess 4 colors at a time to figure out the order and colors of the sequence that the computer generated. Black pegs represent how many correct colors in the correct spot in the sequence the player guessed. White pegs represent how many correct colors in the wrong spot in the sequence the player guessed.
